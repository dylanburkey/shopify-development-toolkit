# Prime Context for the AI Coding Assistant (catch it up to speed on the project when starting a new conversation)

Start with reading the CLAUDE.md file if it exists to get an understanding of the project.

Read the README.md file to get an understanding of the project.

Read key files in the directories:
- sections
- blocks
- assets
- config
- layout
- locales
- templates
- vendor

Explain back to me:
- Project structure
- Project purpose and goals
- Key files and their purposes
- Any important dependencies
- Any important configuration files

Create a summary document that captures all this information for future reference and save it as PROJECT_SUMMARY.md in .claude/project-planning/

The document should include some recommendations for the current development priorities and next steps:
- Highlight critical features to implement next
- Suggest potential improvements or optimizations
- Note any technical debt or areas needing attention
- Identify dependencies that need to be resolved
- Suggest testing strategies for new features
- Recommend documentation updates needed
- Suggest code review processes for upcoming changes
- Outline potential refactoring opportunities
- Suggest ways to improve code quality and maintainability
- Identify security considerations for upcoming changes
- Suggest performance optimization opportunities
- Recommend monitoring and logging improvements
- Suggest deployment and CI/CD process enhancements
- Suggest ways to improve team collaboration and communication
- Suggest metrics and KPIs to track for project success
- Suggest onboarding and knowledge transfer improvements for new team members
- Suggest ways to scale the project for future growth
- Suggest strategies for handling project scope changes and feature requests
- Suggest approaches for managing technical debt over time
- Suggest methods for tracking and measuring project progress
- Suggest ways to ensure code consistency and style across the project
- Suggest approaches for handling legacy code integration
- Suggest methods for managing environment-specific configurations
- Suggest ways to handle multi-environment deployments and configuration management
- Suggest strategies for managing dependencies and versioning
- Suggest approaches for handling internationalization and localization
- Suggest methods for optimizing asset loading and performance
- Suggest ways to manage database schema changes and migrations
- Suggest approaches for handling API versioning and backward compatibility
- Suggest methods for implementing proper error handling and logging
- Suggest strategies for managing user permissions and access control

The summary should be well-structured with clear headings and bullet points for easy reference and future planning.

This document is intended to serve as a comprehensive reference for understanding the project and guiding future development decisions. It should be updated regularly as the project evolves to remain an accurate and useful resource for the development team. All suggestions and recommendations should be prioritized based on impact, urgency, and alignment with project goals.
